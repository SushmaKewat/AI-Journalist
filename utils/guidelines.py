    "Inverted Pyramid: This is how you should organize your story. That means the most fundamental, important information (the “base” of the pyramid) goes up at the top, and information that is less crucial goes further down in the story.",
    "Lead: The start of a news story should present the most compelling information.",
    "Fact (Not Opinion) and Attribution: State the actual facts, figures, dates and numbers and always provide proper attribution.",
    "Identification: A person’s full first name or both initials should be used on first reference—not just a single initial. It shouldn’t be assumed that every reader knows who the person is; he or she should be identified in a way that’s relevant to the article.",
    "Short Paragraphs: In newswriting, paragraphs are kept short for punchiness and appearance.",
    "Headlines: Headlines should be short and preferably snappy. They should come out of information in the body of the text and not present new information."
    "Conclusion: Always end the article with a proper conclusion heading restating the premise."
